==***  Whack_A_Mole!! ***==

Welcome to this version of Whack_A_Mole. The rules of the game are simple and the code easily customized to showcase a variety of functions. 

To play: the player "whacks" as many moles within 10 seconds. A single mole will appear in a random square and a point is earned if the cursor clicks on the mole before it disappears. Both countdown and score are displayed on the game board. 

An alert message appears and indicates the game is over along with the final score. A second alert message informs the player to click on the start button to commence another round and beat the last score.

The "mole" was created in PNG format (using "Canva" -a graphics platform) and placed in the repository and url-tracked in CSS. 

Properties, Methods, functions used in this version:
Boolean;
querySelector()
addEventListener()
setInterval and clearInterval
classList
forEach
arrow functions
window alert
Math.floor
Math.Random

Challenges:
Initiating and then restarting the game after each round, required the most attention and test trials.

Understanding the steps to clearing the score and resetting the timer was a tedious process of trial and error that centered on mastering the use of setInterval and clearInterval. 

Thanks for reading and Enjoy the GAME!
