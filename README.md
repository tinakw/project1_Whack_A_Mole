Welcome to this version of Whack_A_Mole. The rules are simple and the code easily customized to showcase a variety of functions. 

To play: the player "whacks" as many moles within 10 seconds, counting down to 0. The game is played on a grid. One mole will appear in random squares and a point is earned if the player clicks the cursor on the mole before it disappears. Both countdown and score are displayed on the game board. 

An alert message appears and indicates the game is over along with the final score. A second alert message informs the player to click on the start button to commence another round and beat the last score.

JavaScript contains:
Boolean;
querySelector();
addEventListener();
setInterval and clearInterval;
classList;
forEach;
arrow functions;
window alert;
Math.floor; and
Math.Random

HTML contains: 
classes to build out
the gameboard uses a 9-square "grid", with each "square" uniquely(id) numbered 1-9;
two hyperlink anchors to display: "Time-Left" and "Score";
button to "start" and restart the game;

CSS contains: 
styling specifications for html, header and body elements;
"mole" graphic was created in PNG format (using "Canva" graphics platform) and migrated into the game repository and url-tracked in CSS.

Challenges:
Once the functionality to start and execute the game were determined, finessing the quality of the player experience was an area to improve. Initiating and then restarting the game after each round provided an opportunity to assess the code sequencing.

Several iterations were done to breakdown the game into three stages of the game: Initial Start, Game Over and Game Restart. Each phase involved adjustments to align mole movement, scoring, and timing at each phase.

Thanks for reading and Enjoy the GAME!
